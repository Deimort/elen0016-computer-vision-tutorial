# Presentation of your results

## Poster
To present your results, you need to write a poster which describes your method(s) and highlights your results.

## Submission of results.
For the submission of your results on the test set, I will send you the test sequence at 15:00 (see [SCHEDULE.md](SCHEDULE.md) for the schedule) the sequence and will open the submission platform for **20 minutes**. You need to provide the results as follows: the first line counts the number of cells per droplet (row 0 means 0 cell, row 1 means 1 cell, ...). The following lines are used to give the prediction made for differents frames (we will give you the indexes of those frames). Note that the frame are indexed as in Cytomine (0, N-1). The formatting of the file is comma (',') separating value (CSV) as in the [example](example.csv).
